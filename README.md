# EclipsingBinariesProgram

NOTE: A newer and more formal version of the program is under development here: https://github.com/FunkyNoodles/EclipsingBinariesLightCurveGenerator
This is a program I wrote to accompany my brief research on Eclipsing Binaries.

The algorithm may not be the most efficient, but it seems to work.
